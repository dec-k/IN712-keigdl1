I've included both my original and my one intended for submission.
For grading, use the one in 'Submission'. If you're interested though,
please look at the original one that I spent a lot of time working on before
I realised it wasn't going to be worth anything.

The assignment says we are marked upon originality and design, something that is
very difficult to achieve with a fixed layout we must adhere to.
